# Network-Connectivity-and-System-Health-Test-Automation
This project automates the process of testing network connectivity, simulating real-world conditions, and verifying hardware performance. The goal is to evaluate the stability of network connections (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet) and ensure that the system's health remains optimal over time.
